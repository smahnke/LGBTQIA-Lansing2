    <h5 id="overview">Overview:</h5>		  
    <p>Lansing, Michigan has a history of LGBT culture but has faced challenges that limit the presence of these establishments. A quick dig into Lansing State Journal's archive reveals Michigan Avenue as a once-hailed "Sin Strip" filled with LGBTQ bars, and adult shops lining the 500 block where Cooley Stadium now sits. It is a history few residents know because many public LGBTQ establishments have lived short lives, often struggling in the face of low attendance and urban redevelopment.</p>
    <p>Though the once gay space of Michigan Ave. dispersed into today’s few remaining LGBT sites in Lansing, the signs of low attendance and replacement with other commercial establishments points to downtown Lansing as either (1) exhibiting symptoms of a post-gay landscape, one which no longer feels sexuality to be a necessary marker of space (Brown, 2004; Ghaziani, 2014), especially amongst the newer generations of LGBTQ population (Nash, 2012), and/or (2) a common result of urban redevelopment which pushes sexual culture from public to private spaces (Warner, 1999).</p>
    <p>As a response to these patterns, this digital project began as part preservation of Lansing’s LGBT cultural heritage and part participatory mapping of the experiences and meanings behind these sites by LGBT residents. By looking closer at the proliferation and closure of Lansing’s LGBT spaces and audio interviews of long-time residents, the project asks (1) Has the effects of these patterns and closures on long-time residents aligned with those experienced in what the literature has described as “post-gay landscapes”? (2) How does the loss weigh differently on locals, particularly those traditionally underrepresented in gayborhoods? And (3) How have locals responded to this loss?</p>

    <h5 id="background">Background:</h5>
	<p>The literature has referred to gay spaces as areas demarcating LGBT culture by material and symbolic markers of this culture (i.e. a territoriality marked with rainbow flags, businesses, commemorations, anchor institutions, etc.). Such spaces began in the late 60s to early 70s as a reprieve and safe haven from a specific form of oppression (Castells, 1983; Knopp; 1990). However, researchers have noted the marked decline of gayborhoods in recent years (Brown, 2014; Lovett, 2011), citing a mixture of causes precipitating this pattern such as urban redevelopment, and a post-gay attitude that is often complemented by a trending cosmopolitan urbanism.</p>
	<p>The idea that LGBT have moved “beyond the closet” and into mainstream culture was popularized in commentaries by Seidman (2002), Sullivan (1996), and Warner (1999), but found the phrase “post-gay” through Out Magazine’s editor James Collard (Ghaziani, 2014). Sensing a greater tolerance and assimilation of gays into the mainstream, the “post-gay” generation places little emphasis on distinguishing their sexuality and often don’t feel they share the same fate as other LGBT (Egan et al., 2008; Brown, 2006). Previous LGBT spaces have also been redeveloped by commodifying LGBT culture to attract “straight tourists” who want to live a more diverse, cosmopolitan lifestyle (Collins, 2004; Reynolds, 2009). The resulting mixing of sexual difference has rewritten previously gay spaces into commercialized areas wherein sexual distinction is no longer a dominant feature.</p>
